# Singing

The workshop’s objective is to develop the awareness and vocal music with a repertoire that, by its nature, can be learned and implemented without any specific musical knowledge. The course is divided on three levels:

  1. Voice exercises
  1. Repertoire and polyphony learning
  1. Performance accompanied with musical instruments.

Voice exercises are made through a series of exercises based on folk music tradition. Repertoire learning includes a first phase in which whole group studies the original melody with special attention to the phonetics.  When you know the melody and the text, the choir starts to work on polyphony. The third phase includes performance with musical instruments with cooperation of many musicians or amateurs. As in popular traditions, the orchestra changes its personnel on the basis of availability and capability of the musicians. The musical pieces are created or changed in a moment, depending on the individual’s technical background, which allows also to the musicians beginners to participate in choral performance.
