## Previous Instruments

### 2014. -- Caxixi

Caxixi is an old African instrument which was used by the old shamans to scare away evil spirits. Eventually it became a basic accompaniment and rhythmic base in almost all African percussion ensembles.

### 2013. -- Kalimba

Various kinds of thumb pianos have existed in Africa for thousands of years. The tines were originally made of bamboo but over the years metal keys have been developed. The instrument is known by different names in different regions of Africa, including mbira huru, mbira njari, hurdy gurdy, mbira nyunga, marimba, karimba, kalimba, likembe, and okeme, as well as [marímbula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar%C3%ADmbula) (also called kalimba) in the Caribbean Islands.

The kalimba appears to have been invented in Africa, on the west coast of Africa about 3000 years ago…

The Kalimba was typically played while walking by traveling [griots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griot) ([West African](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Africa) historian, storyteller, praise singer, poet and/or musician) who keep the history of the tribe or village, and to entertain people with songs, stories, poems, dances, etc.

One of its indigenous names for this instrument can be translated, “The thing that makes walking easier.”

It was thought in ancient times that the thumb piano was able to project its sound into the heavens and could draw down spirits to the earth…
