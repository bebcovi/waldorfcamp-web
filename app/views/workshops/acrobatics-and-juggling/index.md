# Acrobatics & Juggling

In the first part of this workshop we will practice some general physical movements. Then we will start practicing acrobatics from the basic exercices to more difficult ones, depending on how we feel and how well we prepare our bodies -- the muscles need to learn to be in tension at the right moment and to find the balance between different movements.

On the juggling exercises we will pay attention to the rhythm and practice throwing and catching elements at individual and collective figures.

**Leader**: Daniel Torron Mack
