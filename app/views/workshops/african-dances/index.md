# African dances

This hot summer we will enjoy in african dances. In the last few years the African dances become a very popular form of fun and recreation also in other parts of the world! In Africa they are performed even today on the occasion of various events, such as initiation, birth, weddings, celebration of fruitful year... African dances are very energetic and joyful, include all muscle groups and are great fun and recreation for children and adults. Igor is eager to teach us new movements!
