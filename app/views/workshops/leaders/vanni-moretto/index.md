# Vanni Moretto

I am primarily involved in music, all kinds of music, regardless of the type or period. My destiny directed me to specialize in particular the music of my hometown Milano, but in this case I do not make difference between the types so I work with symphonic genre, folk music, jazz and so on...

I am musical director of the orchestra Fugiens Atalanta which created several CDs with Sony with symphonies written in Milano in 18th century. Moreover, I cooperate with the University in Milano in the research of the repertoire of my hometown.

As far as the folk music is concerned, I use my father's collection of texts and songs. Whole that material is starting point for the things that I love the most (which is unfortunately the least profitable): creating of music.

I like to play in orchestra, so I play several instruments: Violins and double bass with three, four and five string configurations, collaborating with the most vibrant ensembles of the Italian and Swiss music scene.

With my compositions and conducting I won various important contests. I really do not know their aim, but I am told that is very good to be mentioned in my CV. I have had several concerts in major venues worldwide.
