# Singing & Playing

During this workshop we will sing and play, so don't forget to bring your instruments! There is no need for any specific musical knowledge.

Voice exercises are made through a series of exercises based on folk music tradition. Repertoire learning includes a first phase in which whole group studies the original melody with special attention to the phonetics, proceeding to work on polyphony. The third phase includes performance with professional or amateur musicians. Let’s make music together--with vocalism, improvisation and Italian folklore songs!
