# Caxixi

For all of you who are interested in traditional instruments, Igor is organizing a Caxixi workshop. Caxixi is an old African instrument which was used by the old shamans to scare away evil spirits. Eventually it became a basic accompaniment and rhythmic base in almost all African percussion ensembles.

The material is of such a nature that it can knit out any kind of forms. The bottom is made of the pumpkin and filled with some seeds that produce sound. Size varies from palm-sized to the size of basketballs. Prices are from 15 to 30 €, depending on the size of the instrument.
