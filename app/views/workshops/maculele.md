## Maculele

Maculele is an old war dance in which two people are "struggling" with sticks! Struggling is performed in a circle made of people with songs and sounds of drums. First, everyone will make their own pair of sticks, paint it in their war paint and then move the workshop movement, songs and rhythms.
