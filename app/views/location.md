# Olib, Croatia

Olib is one of the most beautiful Croatian islands located in the Zadar archipelago just east if the island Silba and west of the island Pag. Olib area is only 26kmÂ², and there isonly one village on the island that dates back to Roman times, but has many lovely and hidden coves, as well as the wide, sandy and shallow beaches offering great oportunities for bathing, boating and playing.Olib is also very green fertile island with many kinds of produce including good wine, olives, fish and a very good sheep's cheese. There are no cars and the island has a quiet, relaxing and friendly atmosphere. There are a few restaurants, bars (Milivoj's bar by the mole is very well known for their offerings and music!), a shop, post office, exchange office and tourist board office. Olib island is a great place for cycling!

## Transfer

You can take a ferry from Zadar which will only take about two hours. You may check for ferry schedules at [Jadrolinija](http://www.jadrolinija.hr) to avoid any inconvenience (District of Zadar: Zadar -- Premuda/Mali Losinj).

You can also take the catamaran ([Miatours](http://www.miatours.hr)) which is faster, but no cars or bikes are allowed. On catamaran there is also a baggage limit - one piece of baggage is allowed per person. It is desirable to buy a ticket for the ferry or catamaran in advance, and if you are interested in this possibility, please contact the organizers.
