# Olib 2015

We are offering you a perfect choice for an active and dynamic vacation at island Olib--a true pearl among Croatian islands! Join us at the international family Waldorf Summer Camp which is to take place from the August 2nd to 16th and 17th to 23rd 2015.

## One, Two or Three Weeks

Two weeks of Waldorf Summer Camp will be held as usually from Sunday 2 August to Sunday 16 August. For the first time an additional week from Sunday 16th to Sunday 23rd of August is offered!

So this year there is an option to stay on Olib for the first 2 weeks, all 3 weeks, or only the 3rd week.

## Location

Olib is one of the most beautiful Croatian islands located in the Zadar archipelago. The first sight of the island can leave you breathless, as it fills you with peace, the smell of Mediterranean plants and the intense colour of the Adriatic. There is only one village on the island that dates back to Roman times, but has many lovely and hidden coves, as well as the wide, sandy and shallow beaches offering great opportunities for bathing, boating and playing.

There are no cars and the island has a quiet, relaxing and friendly atmosphere. There are a few restaurants, bars (Milivoj's bar by the mole is very well known for their offerings and great music!), a shop, post office, exchange office and tourist board office. Sports and recreation lovers can enjoy the cycling and jogging trails, as well as beach volleyball and basketball. If you would like to learn about the traditions of the island you can visit the local families which maintain traditional skills, such as making olive oil, cheese and vine.

## This Year's Activities

For this camp we have prepared workshops for children and parents: circus for kids, acrobatics and juggling, water sports, woodcarving, Brazilian dance Jongo, yoga, Croatian language course, music workshop, the game of shadows, social games and outdoor games.

### [Circus for Kids](/workshops/circus-for-kids) <small>first two weeks</small>

Circus activities are a great way to get kids up and moving, and to foster their creative side. This workshop encourage children to be active, help develop fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination. It also inspires children to be cooperative through play and provides them a beautiful sense of accomplishment. Circus is not only fun, but great exercise, since it builds muscle and flexibility, along with confidence, trust, and teamwork. Circus is great for children as young as 3 and a wonderful unforgettable experience for kids of all ages. Circus workshop will give children the chance to explore and enjoy spinning plates, hula hooping, diabolo, ball, rings & club juggling, rhythmic ribbon, poi spinning, one wheel bike, etc. Kids will have a lot of fun practicing circus skills like acrobatics, juggling, balancing, clowning and a few magic tricks with Daniel. After trying everything they want, the kids will choose a few elements to practice with. Then, at the end, we would like to make a nice performance for island Olib's community.

This workshop is meant for children, but parents are welcome!

### [Acrobatics and Juggling for Teens and Adults](/workshops/acrobatics-and-juggling) <small>first two weeks</small>

Have you ever imagined yourself juggling with balls or fire torches, stilt walking, hula-hooping (more than one hoop) or being part of a human acrobalance statue? In the first part of this workshop we will practice some less demanding physical movements. Later on we will start practicing acrobatics from the basic exercises to the more difficult ones, trying to find out the balance between different movements.

### [Water Sports](/workshops/water-sports) <small>first two weeks</small>

Water sports for children will take place in safe conditions with all protective equipment, and include: diving, swimming strokes, snorkelling, competitive sports with ball, and various games and activities in the sea. The purpose of these workshops is that participants get a good workout, to better manage their fear of depths, to improve their swimming strokes, and for just plain fun. :)

Necessary equipment for these workshops is already secured, but parents should provide their children with personal gear such as mask, snorkel, and fins.

This workshop is meant for children, but parents are welcome!

### [Brazilian Dance “Jongo”](/workshops/jongo) <small>first two weeks</small>

Jongo is a dance which celebrates life and fertility. It originates from 19th century southeast Brazil as a result of various Afro-Brazilian cultural manifestations of the Banto people.

Jongo is usually performed in a circle formed by participants who clap and sing to the beats of traditional drums. An essential feature of the language of Jongo is the use of symbols, supposedly having magical functions like: the fire, the drums, dancing in circles with the couple in the centre, the rich metaphors used by jongueiros (participants of the Jongo) to compose their ‘pontos’ and whose meaning is inaccessible to the uninitiated. The ritual of Jongo reminds us of the significance of life, the importance of unity, and of the rhythm that is in all things.

In its original form this dance was strictly restricted to the initiated or more experienced in the community. But on island Olib everyone can participate in the Jongo; men, women and children! For women, it is recommended to don loose multi-coloured dresses if at all possible.

### [The Game of Shadows](/workshops/game-of-shadows) <small>first two weeks</small>

This workshop serves to remind children that it’s possible to play games without “special” equipment. For the game of shadows, only light and imagination are required! The children will be shown various configurations of palms and fingers to create a dance of shadows with. At the end of the workshop, the participants will take part in a play of shadows.

This workshop is meant for children, but parents are welcome!

### [Croatian Language Course](/workshops/croatian-language) <small>first two weeks</small>

You think Croatian language is to complex and impossible to learn? You will change your opinion if you join this cheerful workshop, full of laugh and joy. Get to know the basics of the Croatian language in a fun way with a song, recitation, acting and socializing with Lada and Helena. Final performance will reveal a hidden actor in you!

### [Yoga](/workshops/yoga)

With Lidija, we practice yoga to find again our inner peace that connects us to the universal energy and opens us to love. We practice in the morning in a pine forest, listening to the waves. The physical exercises strengthen and relax your body, while the breathing exercises activate our vital energy. The power of yoga healing will increase your memory power, enthusiasm, and positive approach to life.

### [Arts & Crafts](/workshops/arts-and-crafts) <small>all three weeks</small>

Petar will never teach you how to move you brush or take care about perspective, but he will definitely discover a real and hidden artist in you! This year we will focus on woodcarving, making wooden sculptures, boats and other nice things. For those of you who love painting we will offer also this possibility - you should just tell us on time so we can provide canvas and colors for you. Kids will create art by combining different materials collected around us and transform into art by their rich imagination! It's good to remember that Petar's workshops always focus on process rather than "perfect" results.

### [Singing & Playing](/workshops/singing) <small>first two weeks</small>

During this workshop we will sing and play, so don't forget to bring your instruments! There is no need for any specific musical knowledge.

Voice exercises are made through a series of exercises based on folk music tradition. Repertoire learning includes a first phase in which whole group studies the original melody with special attention to the phonetics, proceeding to work on polyphony. The third phase includes performance with professional or amateur musicians. Let’s make music together--with vocalism, improvisation and Italian folklore songs!

### [Social Games for Children](/workshops/social-games) <small>first two weeks</small>

With Igor fun never ends: guided and organized games for the smallest ones and for older children. In addition to creative and educational contents enriching our joint vacations, our favorite aim is to experience, together with our children, the joy of a regular human contact through live word, movement, music and other activities.

## Additional Workshops <small>not included in the participation fee</small>

### [Making a Musical Instrument](/workshops/rain-stick) <small>first two weeks</small>

This year, we will make a “rain stick”--Aztec instrument used in rainmaking rituals. With this instrument, the Aztec hoped to wake the gods of thunder and rain.

**Notice**: this instrument is supposed to be played only on the last day! :)

### [Archery](/workshops/archery) <small>first two weeks</small>

This workshop gives you the opportunity to learn one of the techniques of traditional archery. We will practice with hungarian [magyar bows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_bow#Hungarian_bow) and arrows. This practice makes it easier to concentrate and relax and to find the middle point between up and down and right and left. It can be a kind of meditation if we make slow and integral movements.

### [Thai Massage Therapy](/workshops/massage) <small>first two weeks</small>
