# Workshops

We have prepared workshops for children and parents: arts & crafts, African
dances, yoga, Croatian language course, music workshops, treasure hunt,
social games and games in the sea and outdoor. Some of our activities and
gathering will take place in a local play yard near the restaurant and some
in other places provided by the generous Olib community.

We are also going to continue with the National Evenings which are a firm
tradition. National evenings are good oportunity to connect with other
nations and to teach others about your country!
