      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Besides enjoying our summer vacation in a clean, quiet and safe natural
        environment, we are giving our children the opportunity to spend time
        and make friends with other children from different countries,
        encouraging them to learn and get comfortable with foreign languages,
        which develops tolerance and interest towards others, their lifestyle
        and culture. This all happens in a spontaneous and natural way through
        participating in various games and artistic, physical and ecological
        activities. Being aware of the traditional ways of social interaction
        getting close to extinction, we are doing our best to show our children
        the joy that can come out of ordinary human interaction through live
        word, movement, community work etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        All activities include parents and children. Such social interaction in
        which parents and children acknowledge each other in new way, as
        partners in having fun and creating in a happy and playful environment,
        strengthens the bond between them in the most beautiful way and creates
        a strong, warm imprint in their memories.
