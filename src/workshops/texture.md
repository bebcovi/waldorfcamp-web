We can see the usage of texture in sculpture, architecture and painting. In sculpture and architecture texture is real, while in painting it's often being imitated. Artificial texture is created using techniques like repeating a certain element or collages from various materials.

In this workshop you'll learn about the concept and usage of texture in art and the role it plays in forming perception and the process of creating a work of art.
