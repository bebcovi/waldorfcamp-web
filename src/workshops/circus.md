We will have a lot of fun practicing circus skills like acrobatics, juggling, balancing, clowning and a few magic tricks. After trying everything they want, the kids will choose a few elements to practice with. Then, at the end, we would like to make a nice performance.

- **Acrobatics**: rolls, standing on the head and hands, wheel, lots of positions standing on eachother and building easy pyramids...
- **Juggling**: with scarfs, balls, playing diabolo, spinning the plate, throwing rings, playing flowerstick...
- **Balancing**: balance ball, rolla-bolla, slack-line, unicycle...
- **Clown**: some short and funny sequences for children.
- **Magic**: a few tricks with acting parts.
