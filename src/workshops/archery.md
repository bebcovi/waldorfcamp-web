This workshop gives you the opportunity to learn one of the techniques of traditional archery. We will practice with hungarian [magyar bows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_bow#Hungarian_bow) and arrows. This practice makes it easier to concentrate and relax and to find the middle point between up and down and right and left. It can be a kind of meditation if we make slow and integral movements.

Our art of target will take the name of intuitive target. For the children we will change our shooting position and put some different things on the target.
