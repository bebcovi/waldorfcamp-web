Petar will teach us how to make a traditional dish named Soparnik which originated from the area where the people from Olib came from and is on the list of protected intangible cultural assets at UNESCO.

Together we will make 'sinija' wooden boards for placing the dough and we have to make an open stone oven 'komin' for baking it. It will be a great „finale“ of our camp this year.
