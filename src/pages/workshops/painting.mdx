You will never be tought how to move you brush or how to care about perspective, but you will
definitely discover a hidden artist in you! Painting with acrylic colors will help you to learn about
shadows, colors, volume, light, realistic and abstract style, working from both observation and
imagination. Petar’s workshops always focus on process rather than “perfect” results.

Even though we will supply painting easels, palletes, colors and different canvas formats, attendants
can also bring their own equipment for other artistic techniques. We will observe the paintings each
day to help attendants develop new possibilities for their paintings. After the first week attendants
should come up with a general idea about the style, motif and feel of their paintings. During the last
few days, they can submit their paintings to the gallery for everyone to enjoy.
