Want to play games, invent characters and have fun? In this workshop you learn the fundamental principles of improvised theater, which also happen to be the general techniques for having fun. And you donâ€™t need to have any prexisting knowledge of either theater or funnyness, you only need to speak English. The leaders are Arne M. Ditlefsen and Annika Herrestad, who play and teach improv in Oslo and perform the improvised 2 person musical _Swipe_ together at _Det andre teatret_.
