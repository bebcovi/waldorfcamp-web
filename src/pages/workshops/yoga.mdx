With Lidija, we practice yoga to find again our inner peace that connects us to the universal energy and opens us to love. It is easier to achieve this on Olib because the energy of friendship we cherish for years helps us. We practice in the morning in a pine forest, listening to the waves. The physical exercises strengthen and relax your body, while the breathing exercises activate our vital energy. Through the practice of meditation you will learn to focus your mind in order to perceive the "self", achieve a clearer mind, improve your concentration, and discover the wisdom and tranquility within you. The power of yoga healing will increase your memory power, enthusiasm, and positive approach to life.
